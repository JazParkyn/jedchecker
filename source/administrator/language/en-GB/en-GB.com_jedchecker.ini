COM_JEDCHECKER_UNZIP_FAILED="Unzip failed"
COM_JEDCHECKER_CONGRATS="Congratulations! If you use this component then you've most probably developed a Joomla!Â® extension! Now comes the &quot;hard&quot; part - getting it listed in the Joomla Extension Directory (JED). The JED has strict requirements to the extensions that get listed there. Those requirements can be found <a href='%s' target='_blank'>here</a>. Currently extensions are being manually tested for code problems. This component is an attempt to simplify your and the JED editors life's by automatically checking the code for common errors in extensions."
COM_JEDCHECKER_CODE_STANDARDS="However our goal is not only to test the extensions against common code errors that prevent it from getting listed in the JED. Our goal is to also have code standards checks such as the <a href='%s' target='_blank'>JPlatform has</a>. This would ensure that joomla extension developers are aware of the JPlatform coding standards and this could raise the quality bar in our Joomla community even higher! For this we will need you! Have a look at the <a href='%s' target='_blank'>github project page</a>. Fork the component! Add your code checks and send us your pull requests!"

COM_JEDCHECKER_HOW_TO_INTERPRET_RESULTS="How to interpret the results?"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1="Rule SE1 - Extension is missing index.html file in all folders"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_DESC="If you want your extension to be listed on the JED, then you should make sure that all your extension folders contain an index.html file. - Developers don't like this rule at all - it fills your package with index.html files, which in terms slows down the installation process etc. But index.html files provide protection for badly configured hosts (one could argue if we need to try to do anything for those), but as long the joomla CMS comes with those files the JED is going to require that extensions also have those."
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_MORE_INFO_INTERPRETING="The JEDchecker checks every single folder in your package for the presence of index.html files,but this doesn't mean that all folders need to have an index.html file. For example - language folders don't need to have an index.html file, because the joomla CMS has index.html files in those locations.If your package has the following structure:"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_MORE_INFO_INTERPRETING1="Properly reading the JEDchecker results for SE1:"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_MORE_INFO_INTERPRETING2="If the JEDchecker tells you that you have missing index.html in the following folders:"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_MORE_INFO_INTERPRETING3="You actually need to worry only about"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_SE1_MORE_INFO_INTERPRETING4="as those 2 folders won't have the index.html files when your component gets installed"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2="Rule PH2 - PHP Files missing JEXEC security"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH2_DESC="All the PHP files in your extension needs to have a defined('_JEXEC') or die(); statement in the beginning of each file. This ensures that the file cannot be opened outside of the joomla installation and this way increases the security of your site."
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH3="Rule PH3 - License tag missing or incorrect in XML install file"
COM_JEDCHECKER_RULE_PH3_DESC="An install file should include the license information in a license-tag. The license must be GPL or GPL compatible."
COM_JEDCHECKER_EVERYTHING_SEEMS_TO_BE_FINE_WITH_THAT_RULE="Congrats! Everything seems to be fine with that rule!"
